This repository is here to house the assignments I use to learn and grow my skills in HTML and CSS while completing my course. It will serve as a way to show my skills as well as a learning tool. 

I am a hard working and dedicated individual that will soon be graduating from Southwest Techs Web Design Specialist program. This program will provide me with a basic job oriented education in skills such as *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript*, *Version Control*, as well as design principles. 

I chose this course to pursue something I have had a lifelong interest in. My goal with this program is to create and nurture skills that will allow me to pursue a lifelong career in a field that I am interested in and enjoy.
